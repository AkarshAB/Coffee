        <div class="mid-content">A 2017 review of clinical trials found that drinking coffee is generally safe within
            usual levels of intake and is more likely to improve health outcomes than to cause harm at doses of or 4
            cups of coffee daily. Exceptions include possible increased risk in women having bone fractures, and a
            possible increased risk in pregnant women of fetal loss or decreased birth weight. Results were complicated
            by poor study health status, and serving size.</div>

            <ul>
                <li><b>Type of bean.</b> There are two main types of coffee species, Arabica and Robusta. Arabica
                    originates
                    from Ethiopia and produces a mild, flavorful tasting coffee. It is the most popular type worldwide.
                    However, it is expensive to grow because the Arabica plant is sensitive to the environment,
                    requiring shade, humidity, and steady temperatures between 60-75 degrees Fahrenheit. The Robusta
                    coffee plant is more economical to grow because it is resistant to disease and survives in a wider
                    range of temperatures between 65-97 degrees Fahrenheit. It can also withstand harsh climate changes
                    such as variations in rainfall and strong sunlight.</li>
                <li><b>Type of roast.</b> Coffee beans start out green. They are roasted at a high heat to produce a
                    chemical change that releases the rich aroma and flavor associate with coffee. They are then
                    cooled and ground for brewing. Roasting levels range from light to medium to dark. The lighter
                    the roast, lighter the color and roasted flavor and the higher its acidity. Dark roasts produce
                    a black bean with little acidity anda bitter roasted flavor. The popular French
                    roast is medium-dark.Type of roast. Coffee beans start out green. They are roasted at a high

                <li><b>Type of grind.</b> A medium grind is the most common and used for automatic drip coffee makers. A
                    fine grind is used for deeper flavors like espresso, which releases the oils, and a coarse grind is
                    used in coffee presses.</li>
                <li><b>Decaffeinated coffee.</b> This is an option for those who experience unpleasant side effects from
                    caffeine. The two most common methods used to remove caffeine from coffee is to apply chemical
                    solvents (methylene chloride or ethyl acetate) or carbon dioxide gas. Both are applied to
                    steamed or soaked beans, which are then allowed to dry. The solvents bind to caffeine and both
                    evaporate when the beans are rinsed and/or dried. According to U.S. regulations, at least 97% of
                    the caffeine must be removed to carry the decaffeinated label, so there may be trace residual
                    amounts of caffeine. Both methods may cause some loss of flavor as other naturally occurring
                    chemicals in coffee beans that impart their unique flavor and scent may be destroyed during
                    processing.</li>
